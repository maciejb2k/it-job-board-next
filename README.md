# IT Job Board

This app is a frontend for the [IT Job Board Rails API](https://github.com/maciejb2k/it-job-board-rails), which simply displays a list of jobs with filtering, sorting and pagination.

I built this app to learn more about [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering) and new [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Technologies: `React`, `TypeScript`, `Next.js 13.5.5`
